# macOS-buttons-for-discord
macOS inspired traffic light buttons for Discord using BetterDiscord (required). Always visible;
Note of warning, it does remove the inbox and help buttons (or rather hides them) from the top right corner;
NOTE!! Only works in fullscreen mode (may fix at a later date to work in non-fullscreen mode);
